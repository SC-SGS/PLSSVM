# 'autogenerated' directory

Since this directory only contains autogenerated files, these files **must not** be changed manually!

If you want to change the content of the `OpenCL/detail/kernel_source_string.hpp` file, have a look the the 
`*.cl` kernels inside the main `include/plssvm/backends/OpenCL/` directory.
