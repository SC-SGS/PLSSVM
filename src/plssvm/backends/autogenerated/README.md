# 'autogenerated' directory

Since this directory only contains autogenerated files, these files **must not** be changed manually!

If you want to change the content of any file inside the `DPCPP` or `hipSYLC` directories, have a look at the
files inside the main `src/plssvm/backends/SYCL` directory.
